<b>2.</b> Once you click the bookmarklet, choose a mouse to change to. 

<b>3.</b> Click star on this project!

<b>Note:</b> This bookmarklet may not work on some sites. Also, alot of the assets are straight from the [Custom Cursor Website](https://custom-cursor.com).

**ChangeLog:**
**v1** - Made very bad using bookmarklet combiner (old)<br>
**v2** - Made using chat GPT and customization (old)<br>
**v3.0** - Made to look similar to the custom cursor extension, now changes the pointer mouse as well. <br>
  **v3.0.1** - Added 3 mouse cursors, close function breaks the whole thing but ill fix that soon.
